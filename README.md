### **Abstract**  

The **Car Price Prediction and Recommendation System** is an AI-powered **Streamlit web application** designed to estimate used car prices and recommend similar vehicles. The system utilizes **Linear Regression** to predict car prices based on user-selected attributes such as **brand, model, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, owner type, mileage,  transmission** etc. Additionally, it employs **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to suggest similar cars by analyzing features of available vehicles in the dataset.  

The application processes data through **cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling**, ensuring accurate and meaningful predictions. Users can select their preferences, receive a **price estimation with a dynamic range**, and explore a list of **recommended alternatives** matching their selected criteria. This data-driven approach enhances **decision-making for used car buyers**, offering a seamless and efficient experience. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
